"""CRM Automation Example - Automated HubSpot workflows.

This example demonstrates common CRM automation patterns using the HubSpot tool,
including lead qualification, deal management, and reporting.

Workflows:
1. Daily Lead Digest - Find and qualify new leads
2. Deal Pipeline Report - Analyze deals by stage
3. Contact Enrichment - Update contact properties
4. Company Cleanup - Standardize company data

Usage:
    python crm_automation.py --workflow daily-leads
    python crm_automation.py --workflow deal-report
    python crm_automation.py --workflow enrich-contacts
